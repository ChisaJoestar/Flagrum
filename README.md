# Flagrum

Join us over at the [Exineris Discord](https://discord.gg/7cNNwwJKsJ) for everything related to Flagrum and FFXV modding.

**WARNING: Any mods made with Flagrum will be removed by Mod Organiser if it is launched. Flagrum can handle all aspects of managing binmods including uploading to Steam Workshop, so there should be no need to launch it.**

Flagrum is a streamlined modding tool for FFXV that implements support for
key features missing from existing model-focused tooling.

Most notably:
* Proper materials with adjustable inputs
* Support for Subsurface Scattering (no more "Sin Skin!")
* Support for Ambient Occlusion (AO)
* Support for effects (magic, blood, dirt, sweat, wetness, stone, etc)
* Support for MRS textures (no need to split by channel)
* Fixed in-game preview images for mods (including Comrades thumbnails)
* Support for Vertex Colours
* Support for colour variants on Comrades styles
* Proper support for alpha and emission

As well as these key features, Flagrum also greatly simplifies the
old modding workflow and increases the speed of developing mods.

Most notably:
* Zero build times
* Combined tooling (the only two programs required are Flagrum and the Flagrum Blender Add-on)
* Easy viewing and management of all binmods in one place
* Material presets in Blender

## Installation

Flagrum is split into two vital components. The Flagrum desktop application that creates and manages the mods, and the Flagrum Blender add-on that facilitates the Flagrum materials and the export of models to Flagrum's FMD format.

**Flagrum Desktop Application**

Please download the one-click installer from the releases page.

**Flagrum Blender Add-on**

Please download the latest zip from the releases page and "install from zip" from Blender's add-on menu.
