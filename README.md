Join us over at the [Exineris Discord](https://discord.gg/7cNNwwJKsJ) for everything related to Flagrum and FFXV modding.

**WARNING: Any mods made with Flagrum will be removed by Mod Organiser if it is launched. Flagrum can handle all aspects of managing binmods including uploading to Steam Workshop, so there is no need to launch it.**

Flagrum is a streamlined modding tool for FFXV that implements support for
key features missing from existing model-focused tooling.

Most notably:
* Proper materials with adjustable inputs
* Support for Subsurface Scattering (no more "Sin Skin!")
* Support for Ambient Occlusion (AO)
* Support for effects (magic, blood, dirt, sweat, wetness, stone, etc)
* Support for MRS textures (no need to split by channel)
* Fixed in-game preview images for mods (including Comrades thumbnails)
* Support for Vertex Colours
* Proper support for alpha and emission
* Partial support for colour variants on Comrades hairstyles

As well as these key features, Flagrum also greatly simplifies the
old modding workflow and increases the speed of developing mods.

Most notably:
* Zero build times
* Combined tooling (the only two programs required are Flagrum and the Flagrum Blender Add-on)
* Easy viewing and management of all binmods in one place
* Material presets in Blender

## Installation

Flagrum is split into two vital components. The Flagrum desktop application that creates and manages the mods, and the Flagrum Blender add-on that facilitates the Flagrum materials and the export of models to Flagrum's FMD format.

Please find the latest builds and installation instructions on the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Kizari/Flagrum/releases/latest).

## Usage

We have a great list of resources over at the [Flagrum Wiki](https://github.com/Kizari/Flagrum/wiki) that cover the usage of Flagrum and the Flagrum Blender Add-on.
